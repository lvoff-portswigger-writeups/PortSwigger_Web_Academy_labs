## **1. Initial Reconnaissance**

- Logged in as wiener:peter.
- Tested account functionality such as email updates.
- Observed this request in the network tab:

```python
PATCH /api/user/wiener
Content-Type: application/json
{"email": "wiener2@normal-user.net"}
```

- This confirmed that user-level operations were handled by the /api/user/ path.

## **2. Testing Methodology**

I checked whether other API-related resources were publicly accessible.

A common pattern is that /api/ may expose metadata or documentation.

I performed:

```python
GET /api/
```

The response disclosed endpoint documentation:

```python
GET /user/[username]
PATCH /user/[username]
DELETE /user/[username]
```

This revealed a dangerous DELETE endpoint.

## **3. Payload Construction**

Based on the documentation output, I tested the DELETE endpoint:

```python
DELETE /api/user/carlos
```

No authentication errors.

No authorization checks.

The operation succeeded immediately.

## **4. Results and Observations**

- The request deleted Carlos.
- The lab backend considered that as solving the challenge.
- No admin-only verification existed.
- Documentation exposed exactly the endpoint needed to complete the attack.

The entire compromise was possible due to:

- Auto-discovered admin functionality
- Missing authorization on destructive operations
- Overly permissive API exposure
